# Web Embargo

Chrome extension to blacklist specific websites.

### Description
Meant to block sites specified by the user. There are already extentions like this, but this should add more flexibility and customizations. Some features/ideas to add are:

- [ ] actually block sites
- [ ] presets of websites to block like social media or entertainment sites
- [ ] custom colors/light and dark modes
- [ ] rerouting/block page when going to a blacklisted site
- [ ] locked settings with password, timer, or a puzzle (math problem?)
- [x] free to use?

A work in progress.

### Extra
Made with HTML, SASS, Bootstrap, and Javascript.
